# Release Notes

## Unreleased

## v0.1.0 — 2026-08-03

First tagged release. Downloadable as `agent-handoff-bridge-macos.zip` /
`agent-handoff-bridge-windows.zip` from GitHub Releases, or usable via
`git clone`. Verify a download with `python3 handoff_bridge.py --version`
and `python3 handoff_bridge.py check` — both run with no provider tokens
spent and no git repo required.

- Release pass:
  - added `BRIDGE_VERSION`/`--version` to `handoff_bridge.py`;
  - `scripts/package_platforms.py` now bundles the quality-gate scripts and
    `tests/` into the release zips and stamps `START_HERE_*.txt` with the
    version;
  - added `docs/release-process.md` documenting how to cut a release.

- Quality gates pass:
  - added `docs/quality-gates.md` consolidating every enforced rule;
  - added branch naming convention (`type/short-description`) and
    `scripts/check_branch_name.py`;
  - added `scripts/scan_secrets.py` and wired it into `handoff_bridge.py
    check` and `.githooks/pre-commit`;
  - fixed `handoff_bridge.py` failure classification to recognize
    `tool_failure` and stay in sync with `docs/shared-agent-contract.md`;
  - added atomic, cross-process-locked writes (`atomic_write_text`,
    `WriteLock`) for `.handoff/state.json` and `.handoff/current.md`;
  - added `tests/test_handoff_bridge.py` (stdlib `unittest`) covering the
    classification, provider fallback, and shared-write logic, run by
    `handoff_bridge.py check`;
  - added `.githooks/pre-commit`, `.githooks/pre-push`,
    `scripts/install_git_hooks.sh`, and `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

- Platform pass:
  - added cross-platform desktop controller;
  - added macOS `.command` and install launcher;
  - added Windows `.cmd` and PowerShell launchers;
  - added macOS/Windows zip package builder;
  - added platform setup documentation.

- Documentation pass:
  - added documentation index;
  - added architecture guide;
  - added CLI reference;
  - added workflow guide;
  - added Korean operator guide;
  - added security model;
  - linked the new docs from README and validation.
